# 🚀 End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction System

### 📊 Project Overview
Customer attrition (churn) is one of the most critical challenges in the telecommunications industry. This project aims to **predict the probability of a customer leaving the company** to enable proactive retention strategies.

I developed a complete machine learning pipeline, moving from raw data exploration to a fully functional web application deployed in production.

### 🎯 Key Technical Achievements
* **Model Benchmarking:** Compared **Random Forest (80% Accuracy)** vs **Neural Networks (73%)**.
* **Robust Preprocessing:** Implemented a `ColumnTransformer` with `OneHotEncoding` and `MinMaxScaler`.
* **Production Deployment:** Built an interactive web interface using **Streamlit**.
* **Problem Solving:** Resolved MLOps challenges including Python 3.13 compatibility and feature dimension synchronization (23-feature alignment).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **ML:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy
* **App:** Streamlit, Joblib
* **Cloud:** GitHub, Streamlit Cloud
