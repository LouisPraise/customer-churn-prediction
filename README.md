# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction System

### 📊 Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using Machine Learning. I developed an end-to-end pipeline from data analysis to a web application deployment.

**Key Achievements:**
- Compared Random Forest (80% Accuracy) vs Neural Networks (73% Accuracy).
- Built a robust preprocessing pipeline with `ColumnTransformer`.
- Developed a live web app with **Streamlit**.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **ML:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Pandas
- **Deployment:** Streamlit, Joblib
- **Automation:** Python script for real-time inference
